The work done so far is very very good considering this your first backend project, and you have done a great job in implementing the features, but there are some corrections that need to be made in the project.

Search for TODO and DOUBT word in the entire repo to find the tasks that are pending and the doubts that need to be cleared.

also git flow in this project is poor, only 2 commits for the entire project, and the commits are not descriptive, so it is hard to understand what is happening in the project.

There are features requested in the project that are not implemented, and features that are implemented but not requested.
